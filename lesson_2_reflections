What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	two branches merge into a single one. All existing contents are still there, but just without a previous label. All commits in these two branches are listed according to their timeline. If we present them as we did in the diagram, one could clearly see the structure without messing up with anything/structure.
