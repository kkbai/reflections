How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    find difference easily, time saving, efficient, no mistake

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    save some codes and tips, store a working version of the code, know when I made the change

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: more flexible, and less clutter, and more logical. cons: may forget to do so

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    to do so, one can track multiple files simultaneously.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log will give you all the changes have been made, and git diff will let you compare the exact change have been made between two files, using 2 commit IDs

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    with version control, even if I break something, I can still find the working version and then identify which parts went wrong

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    can track with change of code, and progress of projects
